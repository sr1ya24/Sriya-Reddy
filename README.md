# Sriya-Reddy
Hi! My name is Sriya Reddy, and I’m a junior in high school with a strong passion for coding. I love diving into programming challenges, exploring new technologies, and building creative projects. One of my favorite aspects of coding is debugging—it’s like solving a puzzle where every piece needs to fit perfectly. I’m always looking for easier and more efficient techniques to debug complex code, whether it’s using built-in tools like debuggers and print statements or learning how to interpret error messages quickly. I enjoy experimenting with different approaches to identify and fix bugs, turning what can sometimes be a frustrating process into a rewarding learning experience. Coding isn’t just about writing lines of code for me—it’s about problem-solving, improving efficiency, and constantly learning and growing as a programmer.
